= Introduction =

This perl script is used to prep a report for user review with the contents being that of the ZFS ARC Statistics contained in sysctl kstats MIBs.

  Quoting the original author of the script for Sun based systems:

  While ARC is an amazing achievement its memory consumption raises doubts and questions in many administrators and users who view memory as a precious commodity. The Kstat facility provides access to a variety of ARC counters, but interpretting these properly is complex and non-intuative in their raw form, without spending several hours in the arc.c code. The purpose of arc_summary.pl is to provide a historical analysis of the ZFS ARC.

This script is still work in progress.
  * Currently [http://jhell.googlecode.com/files/arc_summary.pl arc_summary.pl] tries to make use of all kstats that are available.
  * It includes some specific system information such as uname, uptime & date in a header.
  * Spills relevant sysctl MIBs at the bottom of the report.
  * Includes kernel memory usage.
  * Has L2 ARC kstats.
  * Current with sysctl MIBs as of ZFS v14. ( Please report new sysctls [http://bit.ly/94ORw0 here])
