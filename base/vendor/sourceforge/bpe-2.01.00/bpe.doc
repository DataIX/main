NAME
       bpe - examine and patch binary files

SYNOPSIS
       bpe [ -abcdeEhkKLmrwxy ] [ -Bext ] [ -ln ] [ -ooffset ]
	   [ -sn ] file ...
       bpe -H
       bpe -v
       bpe -V

DESCRIPTION
       bpe  is a simple, screen-oriented editor for searching and
       editing ordinary files  in  either  ASCII  or  hexadecimal
       modes (directories can be searched on many systems but not
       edited). Files are displayed in n-byte pages (where n is a
       function	of  the  terminal/window size) in separate ASCII
       and hexadecimal windows	and  it	is  possible  to  switch
       between the two windows as required.

       The  size  of  files  that can be edited is not limited by
       available memory.

   Command-Line Options
       -a	align	a  searched-for	string	or  a	selected
		 address at the first column of each window - the
		 default is for the  display  to  be  aligned  on
		 16-byte boundaries.

       -b	create	a backup file with the default extension
		 .bak - the filename must be no longer	than  the
		 maximum  number  of  characters  allowed  for	a
		 directory entry less the characters required for
		 the extension.

		 The  backup file is created automatically in the
		 current directory with the user's effective UID,
		 with  the  GID as specified in creat(2) and with
		 the same  modes  and  modification-time  as  the
		 original  file.  If  a	file  of  the	same name
		 already exists the user will be given the option
		 of replacing it. The backup file is created only
		 on the first access of a given file in the  cur-
		 rent bpe session.

		 A  backup  file  will	not be created for a file
		 that is opened in read-only mode or that is  not
		 an  ordinary  file  or	if  a	lockfile-error is
		 detected.

       -Bext	specify an extension for backup files instead of
		 the default - apart from restrictions imposed by
		 the file-system, ext can be no	longer	than  15
		 characters.  Note  that  the  -b option or the B
		 command is still required to actually	create	a

		 backup file.

       -c	set the cursor position on entry to an edit mode
		 to the top, left-hand corner of the  appropriate
		 window	-  by default the cursor position is set
		 to  the  first	character  of	a   searched-for
		 ASCII/hex  string after a search operation or to
		 the  window  position	representing  a	selected
		 address  after	a  set-current-address operation
		 (the C command can be	used  to  toggle  cursor-
		 positioning on/off).

       -d	clear	the display before accessing each file in
		 the file list and when toggling between the help
		 screens  -  by	default,  bpe updates only those
		 parts of the display that need	to  be	changed.
		 However,  this	can  cause  problems  with  some
		 curses/terminal combinations  that  leave  "old"
		 data  in  the	display. Using the -d option will
		 overcome the problem (the D command can be  used
		 to toggle display-clear on/off).

       -e	disable  error-bell for command and file errors.

       -E	disable error-bell  in	edit  modes  and  during
		 string/address data-entry.

       -h	disable  highlighting	-  by  default,	bpe uses
		 highlighting	in   several   areas   but   some
		 curses/terminal  combinations	have trouble with
		 mixed highlighted  and	non-highlighted  charac-
		 ters,	particularly  over  slow  lines.  The  -h
		 option will solve the problem although	some  of
		 the  visual convenience of bpe will be lost (the
		 H command can be  used	to  toggle  highlighting
		 on/off).

       -k	disable  ESC  as  escape character - by default,
		 ESC (0x1b) is one of the characters that can  be
		 used	to   exit   edit-mode	and   to   abort
		 string/address/data entry. This can cause timing
		 problems,  particularly  over	slow  lines, with
		 terminals that use the escape character  in  the
		 strings  sent	by  the	cursor	keys.	If the -k
		 option is used, ESC will  no  longer  be  inter-
		 preted	as  an	escape character. This option is
		 really of significance only if bpe has been com-
		 piled with keypad enabled.

       -K	disable keypad - this option, which is available
		 only  if  bpe	has  been  compiled  with  keypad
		 enabled,  can	be  useful  with  some	terminals
		 (check the compile-time  defaults  with  the  -V
		 option).  The	"vi-style"  cursor-movement  keys

		 remain available if the -K option is  used  (see
		 under Editing below).

       -ln	set the position of the target line after search
		 and set-current-address  operations  to  line	n
		 where	n  is  an  integer between 1 and 15 - the
		 default is for the target line to be  positioned
		 at the top of the windows (i.e.  n = 1).

       -L	disable  file-locking - by default a lockfile is
		 created for a file opened in read/write mode and
		 any  other  attempt  to  open	the same file for
		 read/write will result in the file being  opened
		 in read-only mode. The -L option disables normal
		 creation of the lockfile although  it	is  still
		 created  (but	removed	as  soon  as the file is
		 open) as a check for its prior	existence.  This
		 option,  which is available only if bpe has been
		 compiled with file-locking  enabled,  should  be
		 used with caution!

       -m	disable  message-receive  - by default the modes
		 of the user's tty are	left  unchanged.  The  -m
		 option	will  clear  group-write and world-write
		 access.  The  original	modes	are  restored  on
		 quitting bpe or when exiting to a shell.

       -ooffset	specify the start-address of the first page of a
		 file that will be displayed when a file is first
		 accessed  instead  of	the default of 0x00 - the
		 offset-address, which should  be  in  the  range
		 from 0x01 to EOF inclusive, can be either octal,
		 decimal or hexadecimal. An octal address  should
		 have a leading 0 and a hex address should have a
		 leading 0x. If there is no leading 0 or 0x it is
		 taken to be a decimal address.

		 The  start-address will be set to 0x00 if offset
		 is outside the legal range for a given file and,
		 in  any  case, will have no effect if a file has
		 already been accessed in the  current	bpe  ses-
		 sion.

       -r	open all files in read-only mode. A file will be
		 opened in read-only mode  automatically  regard-
		 less  of the use of the -r option if it does not
		 have write access but is otherwise accessible or
		 if  a	lockfile  exists  for  that  file (see -L
		 above).

       -sn	set the number of lines to be scrolled with  the
		 +  and	-  commands  to  n where n is an integer
		 greater than 1 - the default is half the size of
		 the  editing  window  (i.e. 8 lines on a 24-line

		 terminal).

       -w	force bpe to use a 24-line by 80-column  display
		 over-riding any window-size information obtained
		 at run-time (see Window Size below).

       -x	do not disable XON-XOFF flow-control. It is dis-
		 abled	by default, partly to avoid the possibil-
		 ity of an unintended CTRL-S  seeming  to  "lock"
		 the   terminal.  However,  flow-control  may  be
		 needed	with  slow  terminals	(particularly  on
		 dial-up lines) but will be available with the -x
		 option only if it is the default state.

       -y	disable display of the file-address  represented
		 by  the cursor-position during editing and file-
		 address display during searching (useful on slow
		 systems and, particularly, with slow terminals -
		 the Y command can be used to toggle address-dis-
		 play on/off).

       A  brief	explanation  of the command-line options will be
       displayed if bpe is called with the -H option. The version
       number  and  date will be displayed with the -v option. If
       the -V option is used the compile-time defaults will  also
       be listed.

   Environment-Variable Options
       Any of the command-line options (other than -H, -v and -V)
       can also be placed in the environment  variable,	BPE,  to
       set  user-preferred, run-time defaults and should take the
       form, for example,  BPE='abcedeEhkKLmrwxyBext lnsnooffset'
       where  n	is an integer, ext is the required extension for
       any backup files and offset is the address at which  file-
       display	should	start  (see -o under Command-Line Options
       for the format). Note that, if B or o  is  given,  ext  or
       offset  respectively  must  be followed by a space and the
       entire argument properly-enclosed in quotes if it  is  not
       the last option on the line. The form given is appropriate
       for the Bourne and Korn shells.

       Any of the BPE options used without a  corresponding  com-
       mand-line  option  (or  vice-versa)  will  have the effect
       listed under Command-Line  Options.   However,  an  option
       given  on the command line that is already set in BPE will
       have its action reversed.

       As an example, BPE=r will put bpe into read-only mode as a
       run-time default but the use of the -r command-line option
       will then enable read/write mode.

       Four exceptions to this general rule are the -Bext, -ooff-
       set,  -ln  and  -sn command-line options where the strings
       ext and offset and the values for n will be used in  place

       of anything set in BPE.

   Buffers
       bpe maintains three main buffers - an edit buffer, a last-
       write buffer and an original-data buffer. The size of  the
       buffers	is determined by the number of lines in the edit-
       ing windows but would be 256 bytes for a "standard"  24	x
       80 terminal.

       The edit buffer contains the data that is displayed in the
       editing windows.

       The last-write buffer reflects any changes that have  been
       written	to  disk and is updated at each write. It is used
       to restore the contents of the edit buffer  to  the  state
       that obtained before any modifications were made after the
       last write. The last-write buffer's contents will  be  the
       same  as	that of the original-data buffer if no write has
       taken place.

       The original-data buffer contains the data read	from  the
       disk before any edit session for that page where a page is
       defined as any editing-window-sized segment of  the  file.
       The current page is that editing-window-sized segment con-
       tained within the buffers' boundaries.

       Note, therefore, that any movement  outside  the	current-
       page boundaries, i.e.  moving to another page, will change
       the buffers' boundaries and, therefore, their contents.

       The start-address of the current page is displayed at  the
       top-right-hand corner of the screen.

       bpe  also  maintains buffers for each file in the argument
       list.  Various file-attributes are saved when  a	file  is
       first  accessed which speeds-up operations during any sub-
       sequent access in the current bpe session.

       The current-page, marker, last-edited-page,  last-set-cur-
       rent-address,   last-successfully-searched-for-string  and
       cursor-offset addresses are also saved for each file  mak-
       ing it possible to return to a file with all previous set-
       tings intact - including any highlighting  from	a  search
       operation.

   Window Size
       The  window-size	is  determined	at  run  time.	bpe will
       attempt to use all of the available lines (unless  the  -w
       option  has  been  used) but the 80-column width is fixed.
       bpe will abort with an error if	the  window/terminal  has
       fewer  than  80	columns or if it has fewer lines than the
       minimum set at compile-time (this can be checked with  the
       -V  option)  or	fewer  than 24 lines if the -w option has
       been used.

       f or /	 find ASCII string (from current address)
       l	      locate hex bytes (from current address)
       L	      goto address of last successfully-searched-
		      for string.
       a	      edit in ASCII window.
       h	      edit in hex window.
       C	      toggle cursor-positioning on/off

       U	      undo  changes  after  the window-buffer has
		      been written to disk  -  this  facility  is
		      available	only if the current file address
		      has not been changed.
       w	      write modified window-buffer to disk.
       CTRL-E	 edit last command-mode entry at  the  file-
		      name,  search-string  and	address  prompts
		      (see under Command Editing below).
       c	      clear status-line
       D	      toggle display-clear on/off
       H	      toggle highlighting on/off - any highlight-
		      ing  already in the display will be removed
		      when highlighting is  turned  off.  Turning
		      highlighting on will restore any highlight-
		      ing that would have been in the display had
		      highlighting  not been off or that had been
		      there before highlighting	was  turned  off
		      with  the	exception  of	any string-search
		      highlighting that had been removed with the
		      r command.
       r	      remove highlighting - any highlighting from
		      a search or edit will be	removed	but,  in
		      the latter case, the window-buffer contents
		      will not be changed.  Highlighting will not
		      be  turned-off.  This  command will have no
		      effect if highlighting is off.
       d	      display highlighting -  restore  any  high-
		      lighting	that  has been removed with the r
		      command. The d command can also be used  to
		      restore  highlighting  to	a  searched-for-
		      string that was removed by entering an edit
		      mode as long as there are no unwritten win-
		      dow-buffer-modifications	present	in   the
		      display  and the string itself has not been
		      edited. Once again, this command will  have
		      no effect if highlighting is turned-off.
       R or CTRL-R    redraw current screen - useful for removing

		      mailer messages and the  like.  The  CTRL-R
		      form can be used from within the edit modes
		      and during data entry at any prompt.
       Y	      toggle address-display on/off
       B	      create a backup of the current  file  (even
		      if  it  has  been opened in read-only mode)
		      regardless of whether the	-b  command-line
		      option  has been used. A backup can be cre-
		      ated only of an ordinary file.
       W	      write (part-of) the current file to  a  new
		      file.
       O	      show  status  of	address-display,  cursor-
		      positioning, display-clear and highlighting
		      options.
       S	      show  file  information  and window-buffer,
		      file-mod,	backup,  lockfile  and	string-
		      search status.
       V	      show version number.
       q	      quit bpe.
       Q	      unconditional quit.
       !	      shell-escape (no arguments accepted) - runs
		      shell set in the SHELL environment variable
		      or defaults to /bin/sh if SHELL is not set.
		      CTRL-Z can  also	be  used  to  initiate	a
		      shell-escape  on	systems on which job-con-
		      trol is not available or has been disabled.
       ?	      display  help  screens  -	the help screens
		      will, where  appropriate,	reflect  compile
		      and  run-time  defaults. As with the X com-
		      mand, any legal bpe command can be  entered
		      at  the  help-screen prompts although user-
		      confirmation is  required	before	quitting
		      bpe directly from help.

   Command Editing
       Simple	line-editing	is   available	when	entering
       string/address data at an appropriate prompt.  CTRL-H  (or
       left-arrow  key	if keypad is enabled) will move backwards
       and CTRL-L (or right-arrow key) will move forwards through
       an  already-entered  string.  DEL  will	delete the single
       character before the cursor or at the  cursor  if  at  the
       beginning  of the string. Insert mode is always on and any
       legal character will be inserted before the cursor.

       Entering CTRL-E will retrieve any  string  entered  previ-
       ously  at that prompt and make it available for editing. A
       string for a particular prompt is carried across from file
       to file.

       A maximum of 63 characters can be entered at any prompt at
       which command editing  is  available.  Data-entry  can  be
       aborted by entering ESC, CTRL-C or CTRL-D.

   Selecting Files
       Move through the files in the argument list with the N, P,
       F, j, J and t commands.

       The N and P commands will move to the  next  and	previous
       files in the argument list respectively.

       The  F  command	will display a numbered list of the files
       with the name of the current file highlighted  (or  marked
       with  square  brackets  if  highlighting	is turned off) -
       select the required file by number. Enter  the  number  of
       the  current file or RETURN on its own to continue editing
       the current file. Note that the length of  the  file  name
       (or  path name) in the display is limited to 19 characters
       - only the last 18 characters are displayed, with a  lead-
       ing  > to indicate that truncation has taken place, if the
       name is longer than the 19-character limit (only the  last
       16  are	displayed for the current file if highlighting is
       turned off). Note, too, that the same truncation from  the
       left  is	used when necessary for the file-name display at
       the top-left of the screen and, when appropriate,  on  the
       status-line.

       The  j command will prompt for a number from the file list
       - enter the number of the current file or  RETURN  on  its
       own to continue editing the current file. Use of this com-
       mand assumes that the user has already  viewed  that  list
       and, thus, knows the number. It provides a quick method of
       switching between files without having to display the full
       list  each  time. If there are only two files in the list,
       the j command will toggle between them.

       The J command will prompt for a name from the file list	-
       note  that the only names that can be used are those which
       were present on the command-line when bpe  was  called  or
       which  were added with the A or E commands. Once again, if
       there are only two files in the list, the J  command  will
       toggle between them.

       The  t  or  #  commands	will toggle between the two most-
       recently-accessed files from the file list. The	names  of
       the  two	files, with that of the current file highlighted
       (or marked with square brackets if highlighting is  turned
       off),  can be shown on the status-line with the T command.
       The commands will have no effect until at least two  files
       have been accessed.

       The  A  or  E  commands	can  be	used to access files not
       already in the file list. Both commands will prompt for	a
       file name and add the name to the file list. The E command
       will also change the current file to the	new  file.  Note
       that there can be no more than 60 files in the list.

   Moving Through a File
       Any  of	the  file-position  commands  can be used to move
       through a file.

       The s command will prompt for a legal address which can be
       either  octal,  decimal	or  hexadecimal. An octal address
       should have a leading 0 and a hex address  should  have	a
       leading	0x. If there is no leading 0 or 0x it is taken to
       be a decimal address. Note that bpe defines the first byte
       of  a  file as being at address 0x00 which may cause minor
       confusion when using addresses given by some other  utili-
       ties that insist that the first byte is at 0x01.

       Several	"shorthand" codes can also be used at the prompt.

       A legal marker [a to z] that has already been  set  to  an
       address	can  be	entered in response instead of an actual
       address, a B or E will give the address of  the	beginning
       or  the	end  of	the file respectively, a C will give the
       start-address of the current  page,  a  G  will	give  the
       start-address of the last page, an L will give the address
       of the last successfully-search-for string, an O will give
       the  offset address entered on the command line, an X will
       give the start-address of the last-edited page, an S  will
       give  the  address entered for the last set-address opera-
       tion and entering just a RETURN will give the last address
       entered at that prompt (this action is duplicated by the @
       command). The last-address string  can  be  retrieved  for
       editing	with CTRL-E but the addresses represented by pre-
       viously-entered "shorthand" codes are not available.

       A set-current-address  operation	can  be  aborted  during
       address-entry  (as  can	any  data-entry	at  a prompt) by
       entering ESC, CTRL-C or CTRL-D.

       Markers can be used to store  addresses	to  enable  rapid
       movement through a file.

       Set  a  marker  with  the  m  command  followed by a valid
       marker-identifier [a to z] at  the  prompt.  The	selected
       marker  will  be	set  to the start-address of the current
       page.

       Set a marker to a specific address with the M command fol-
       lowed, as before, by a valid marker-identifier [a to z] at
       the marker prompt and then a legal address or  "shorthand"
       code (see above) at the address prompt.

       A  marker  can  be  set	from  within  an edit mode to the
       address represented by the current  cursor  position  with
       CTRL-X

       All markers can be cleared with the k command.




LOCAL MANUAL		November 09 1998		      10





BPE(1)							BPE(1)


       Move  to	the  address  represented by a marker with the '
       command followed by a valid marker-identifier [a to z]  at
       the prompt.

       Move  to the address of the last successfully-searched-for
       string, be it hex or ASCII, with the L command (see  under
       Searching). The string will be highlighted in both windows
       if it has not been modified since the search.

       Move to the start-address of the last page that was edited
       with the x command.

       The  current-page, marker, last-edited-page, last-set-cur-
       rent-address   and   last-successfully-searched-for-string
       addresses  are  saved  for  each	file but are not carried
       across from file to file.

   Editing
       Enter edit mode with a for ASCII or h for hex editing.

       Unless the -c option has been used,  the	cursor	will  be
       placed  at  the	start  of a searched-for string or at the
       window-position representing a selected address. If the -c
       option  has  been  used or if the editing session does not
       follow a search or set-current-address operation the  cur-
       sor  will  be placed in the upper, left-hand corner of the
       appropriate window.

       Use the "vi-style" cursor-movement keys -  CTRL-J  (down),
       CTRL-K  (up),  CTRL-H  (left),  CTRL-L  (right) and CTRL-^
       (home) - to place the cursor on the  byte  to  be  changed
       (the arrow-keys can also be used if bpe was appropriately-
       compiled and there is a valid termcap/terminfo entry).

       Enter a printing ASCII character, i.e. from 0x20	to  0x7e
       (32  to 126) inclusive, or a two-digit hex value depending
       on the mode.  Prefixing each character with CTRL-V  allows
       characters  outside the printing-ASCII range to be entered
       in ASCII-edit mode or single characters to be  entered  in
       hex-edit mode.

       Note  that  non-printing	ASCII	characters will be repre-
       sented in the ASCII window by the . (0x2e) character.

       Any changes will be highlighted and will be  reflected  in
       both  windows.  However,	any "changes" that correspond to
       the last-write buffer contents will not be highlighted.

       Any single ASCII character or  hexadecimal  digit  can  be
       returned to its former value with DEL (0x7f).

       Exit  edit  mode by with ESC or CTRL-C and write the modi-
       fied window-buffer to disk with w.




LOCAL MANUAL		November 09 1998		      11





BPE(1)							BPE(1)


       A warning will be given if an attempt is made to	move  to
       another	page, to scroll the display, to edit another file
       or to quit the program if the modified edit buffer has not
       been  written  to disk. The edit buffer can be returned to
       its state after the last write with the u command.  The	Q
       command	can  be	used to quit bpe unconditionally after a
       user-confirmation check even if buffer-modifications exist
       that have not been written to disk.

       If  the	modified edit buffer has been written to disk the
       changes can still be undone with the U command if the cur-
       rent  file  address,  i.e.  the current page, has not been
       changed since the write. Any  changes  made  to	the  edit
       buffer  after  the  last write to disk of that buffer will
       also be undone by the U command. Only the page represented
       by the edit buffer will be affected - any changes to other
       pages previously written to disk will not be undone.

       The file-modification time will be restored on  exit  with
       the  q  command or when moving to another file with any of
       the file-selection commands if all changes written to disk
       have been undone using the U command.

       The  display  can  be refreshed to remove any highlighting
       without altering the buffer contents with the r command.

   Searching
       Search for hex data with the l command and a string of hex
       digits  - a leading x or 0 or a trailing h is not required
       but a leading 0 will be added if an odd number of  charac-
       ters  is entered. The search can be aborted during string-
       entry by entering ESC, CTRL-C or CTRL-D.

       To search again for the same string, enter the  l  command
       and  press  RETURN  - if the starting address has not been
       adjusted the search will	start	one  character	past  the
       location	of the last occurrence found. The last-searched-
       for-string can be edited after entering CTRL-E and is car-
       ried across from file to file.

       Search  for an ASCII string with the f or / command. Enter
       a string at the prompt followed by RETURN  -  once  again,
       the  previous  pattern is used if no pattern is specified.
       Searching is case-sensitive and proceeds as  with  a  hex-
       data search.

       Searching  is  forward from the current file address which
       remains unchanged if the string is not found. Search oper-
       ations do not wrap around after end-of-file.

       Following  a successful search, the display is adjusted to
       put the first byte of the string in the line at the top of
       the screen unless the -ln option has been used.




LOCAL MANUAL		November 09 1998		      12





BPE(1)							BPE(1)


       The  string will be highlighted in both windows unless the
       -h option has been used. Any highlighting of the searched-
       for  string  will  be  retained following a partial-screen
       scroll as long as all of the string is still in	the  win-
       dows  but it will be removed if another search is made. It
       will also be removed when entering an edit mode	to  avoid
       confusion  with	the  highlighting of modified data. The S
       command can be used to check if any  highlighting  is  the
       result of a string-search.

       It  is  possible to return to the file-address of the last
       successfully-searched-for string (which is saved for  each
       file)  with  the	L  command  (see  under Moving Through a
       File).

   Backups and Copies
       For obvious reasons, it is suggested that  a  backup  copy
       should  be  made	before	patching  any file for which the
       source is not available. Backups can be made automatically
       with  the  -b  command-line  option or manually with the B
       command (see above).

       The current file, or any part of	the  current  file,  can
       also be written to a new file with the W command.

       The  user  will be prompted for a filename and, as before,
       previously-entered strings can be used  by  entering  just
       RETURN or by entering CTRL-E for editing. If a file of the
       same name already exists the user will be given the option
       of replacing it, appending to it or quitting.

       The  user  will	then  be  prompted  for	the current-file
       addresses for the segment of the file that is to be  writ-
       ten  to the new file. Enter a legal address at each prompt
       (see under Moving Through a File for  the  format).   Note
       that,  if  the  current	page  is included in the address-
       range, any buffer-modifications that have not been written
       to disk will not be written to the new file.

       The new file will be created with the user's effective UID
       and GID and default permissions.

   Status
       The S command will show the following information  on  the
       status-line.

       [ordinary file]	the	file being examined or patched is
			   an ordinary file.
       [directory]	 the file being examined is a directory
			   -  it  will	have been opened in read-
			   only mode even if the  -r  option  has
			   not been used.
       [file-error]	the file does not exist, it is a zero-
			   byte	file,	its  permissions  do  not



LOCAL MANUAL		November 09 1998		      13





BPE(1)							BPE(1)


			   allow  access or it is a special file.
       [read/write]	the file has been opened  for  reading
			   and writing (normal default).
       [read-only]	 the	file has been opened in read-only
			   mode because the -r	option	has  been
			   used	or  the file is a directory or a
			   file-error or lockfile-error has  been
			   detected.
       [lockfile]	  a  lockfile	has  been created for the
			   file being edited  -	any  attempt  by
			   another  user  to  edit  the same file
			   will result	in  it	being  opened  in
			   read-only mode.
       [nolockfile]	no  lockfile	has  been created either
			   because the file has	been  opened  in
			   read-only   mode  or	because  the  -L
			   option has been used.
       [lockfile exists]   a lockfile for the file  being  edited
			   has	been created by another user - as
			   a result,  the  file	will  have  been
			   opened in read-only mode.
       [lockfile-error]	an  error was detected when attempting
			   to create, read,  write-to  or  delete
			   the lockfile.
       [nobackup]	  no backup file has been created.
       [backup]		a  backup file has been created either
			   by use of the -b option or the B  com-
			   mand.
       [backup-error]	an  error was detected when attempting
			   to create a backup file.
       [nomod]		no modifications have been made to the
			   edit buffer or written to disk.
       [buffermod]	 modifications  have	been  made to the
			   edit buffer that have not been written
			   to disk.
       [filemod]	   modifications  have	been  written  to
			   disk.
       [search]		any highlighting in the  edit  windows
			   is  the result of a successful search.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       bpe checks the BPE environment variable	for  any  default
       run-time	options,  the SHELL environment variable for the
       default shell if the shell escape is used and, of  course,
       the TERM environment variable.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Self  explanatory.  Error  messages are highlighted on the
       status line unless the -h option has been used -	informa-
       tion messages are not highlighted.

       Program-termination is not forced on any lseek(2), read(2)
       or write(2) error but the user should take any  subsequent
       actions with care. The Q command will quit the program and



LOCAL MANUAL		November 09 1998		      14





BPE(1)							BPE(1)


       avoid further disk accesses apart from any associated with
       the file close.

       However,	program-termination  is  forced  on any close(2)
       error or on other than  a  permission-related  error  when
       resetting  the file-modification time (if appropriate) and
       the last error message is retained on the display.

RETURN VALUE
       bpe returns 1 on error, otherwise zero.

BUGS
       This version of bpe does not respond to a SIGWINCH signal.

       The  help,  marker/address  and file-list screens assume a
       24-line by 80-column display and are not adjusted  if  the
       display has fewer than 24 lines.

       The  maximum  number  of characters that can be entered at
       any prompt where command editing is allowed is limited  to
       63.

       Initial	write-accessibility checks use the access(2) sys-
       tem-call - this could lead to  problems	in  some  circum-
       stances.

       The  naming  convention	used  for lockfiles could lead to
       ambiguities with similarly-named files. The first  n  -	4
       characters  of the filename are used for part of the lock-
       file name where n is  the  maximum  number  of  characters
       allowed for a filename. The -L option can be used to over-
       come the problem, should it arise, but it should	be  used
       with caution (see under Command-Line Options above).

       Lockfile-operation  cannot be relied on when editing files

       under NFS.

       Some versions of curses(3X) do not check	the  TERMCAP  or
       TERMINFO environment variables making it impossible to use
       "custom" terminal definitions.

       This version of bpe cannot be used with special files.
