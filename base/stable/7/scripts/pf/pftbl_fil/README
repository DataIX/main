1.0: Writing your rulesets via pf.conf

	In this directory you will find an example pf.conf that has a connection tracking rule 
that allows all connections to port 22/tcp or otherwise known as the OpenSSH port.  Besides 
that port, this blocks all inbound traffic to any other service and hosts that are blacklisted 
+ blocks all outbound traffic to anything that is blacklisted while letting all other traffic 
pass outbound untouched.

	Because of the connection tracking rule for the OpenSSH port and the limits it has, an 
attacker will easily trip the connection count and be added to the blacklist table that gets 
blocked before the OpenSSH pass rule.  This method could be used for other examples as 
blocking spammer connection attempts to a SMTP server.

	Adjusting the connection tracking for your specific environment/server is highly 
reccomended as the example listed in the pf.conf file is for small amounts of traffic that 
should be triggered quickly for SSH logins.

Please reference anything in the pf.conf to the respective manual page pf.conf(5)



2.0: Setting up pftbl_fil.sh

	Use the following in your /etc/crontab to run this every 3 hours or how ever many 
hours you would like to save and get emailed stats.

# Run pftbl_fil.sh every 3 hours to save blacklisted hosts.
0       */3     *       *       *       root    /root/bin/pftbl_fil.sh


	This outputs the following report to the users shell email by default unless the 
output is redirected to /dev/null or somewhere else.

Statistics:
 - Old count in table store:
       1021 /etc/pf/tables/blacklist

 - New count in table store:
       1024 /etc/pf/tables/blacklist

 - Changes to running table:
       3/1021 addresses added.
